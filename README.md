# 🗼Tower  

[Tower](https://www.canarybit.eu/confidential-cloud-tower/) is a security orchestration tool to provision, control and 
maintain Confidential VM instances.
Tower integrates with a long list of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), private and bare-metal infrastructure to provide 
governance of the resources defining your Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

It implements Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and SecDevOps best-practices to provide integrity and state of the art security to your workloads runtime.

## 🌟 Features
- **Confidential VM Orchestration**: Deploy confidential VMs on AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX platforms.
- **Hardware & Environment Verification**: Integrate with [CanaryBit Inspector](https://www.canarybit.eu/confidential-cloud-inspector/) to support Remote Attestation of deployed confidential VMs. Requires a CanaryBit account.
- **Extensible Configuration**: Configure your confidential VM using available configuration options or write your own.
- **No lock-in**: Support for multiple hardware platforms and virtualisation software.

## 🧩 Integrations
- **Galaxy server**: Support for the [Galaxy project](https://github.com/galaxyproject) for data-intensive computation.
- **Write your own**: Simple to create new integrations with custom `cloud-init` configurations.
  
## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Clone** the repository to get the configurations.
2. **Configure** the cloud-init script fine-tune your target setup.
3. **Run** the code and deploy resources on your target infrastructure.
4. **Need help?** Check the examples to help you get started.

## 🧱 Requirements
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) installed;
- Credentials to access your Infrastructure provider (either Public Cloud or On-prem);
- A CanaryBit account. New user? [Create an account](https://canarybit-production.auth.eu-north-1.amazoncognito.com/login?client_id=54g4h9tpulnnkmhivgn5nipjki&redirect_uri=https://docs.confidentialcloud.io/&response_type=code&scope=email+openid+profile)

## 🏀 Use Cases
- **Confidential AI**: Train models in a secure environment to protect intellectual property at all times.
- **Cloud infrastructure security**: Deploy workloads in memory-encrypted VMs to protect workloads from infrastructure operators.
- **On-prem infrastructure security**: Implement defence-in-depth to protect workloads from malicious insiders and motivated adversaries.
- **High-performance computing (HPC)**: Protect security-sensitive HPC workloads
