# 🗼Tower  

[Tower](https://www.canarybit.eu/confidential-cloud-tower/) is a security orchestration tool to provision, control and 
maintain Confidential VM instances.
Tower integrates with a long list of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), private and bare-metal infrastructure to provide 
governance of the resources defining your Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
It implements Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and SecDevOps methodologies to provide integrity and state of the art security
to your workloads runtime.

## 🌟 Features
- 🤹 **Confidential VM Orchestration**: Deploy confidential VMs on AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX platforms.
- 🛠 **Extensible Configuration**: Configure your confidential VM using available configuration options or write your own.
- ⚖️ **No lock-in**: Support for multiple hardware platforms and virtualisation software.
- 🔬 **Attestation verification support**: Integrates with [Inspector](https://www.canarybit.eu/confidential-cloud-inspector/) 
to support remote attestation of deployed confidential VMs. Contact hi@canarybit.eu to learn more about CanaryBit's solution for remote attestation of confidential VMs.

## 🧩 Integrations
- **Galaxy server**: Support for the [Galaxy project](https://github.com/galaxyproject) for data-intensive computation.
- **Write your own**: Simple to crate new integrations using the [cloud-init-generator](https://github.com/canarybit/tower/tree/main/extensions/cloud-init-generator)

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Clone** the repository to get the configurations.
2. **Configure** the cloud-init script fine-tune your target setup.
3. **Run** the Terraform scripts for your target Cloud Service Provider.  
4. **Need help?** Check the examples to help you get started.


## 🧱 Requirements
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) installed;
- Credentials to access your favourite Cloud Service Provider;
- An SSH key to access Confidential VM instances.
